This is the footage released by 11Alive on YouTube.  

With feelings that this footage should be seem by the masses, this is a repost.
Police violence in this country is completely out of control.  Cops kill 3 innocent 
people in this country every day.  By definition they are the largest criminal gang in 
America.  It's called the thin blue line gang.

Think about it, people.  All this woman did to get violently arrested was to ask why she
had to sign.  Then, Officer Brooks 7452 escalates completely out of control.  Refusing to 
sign a ticket is not an arrestable offence.  This is simply a case of this clown's reaction 
to contempt of cop.
