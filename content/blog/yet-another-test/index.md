This is Gatsby running on Netlify.  

This one started as a blog starter.  So far, I've added YouTube embeding, and removed the bio of the fake dude.   I've also rebranded the name of the site.  ::laugh::

With this version smoking the [lighthouse scores at web.dev](https://web.dev/measure/?gclid=CjwKCAjw6fyXBhBgEiwAhhiZsomBRG6o3zyMvSZGg-MWoDmu2N2J25HYLMBI9DSUvRZUmHrZ13oLdxoC1v4QAvD_BwE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbearcountrypublishing.com) 
I decided to flip the switch for this version to the main blog.  It will be a react learning curve.  But, I plan to build it out from here.  

I'm thinking of 
- adding images to the post in the first page
- adding tags for each post and getting those also on the first page and blog pages
- a global navbar at the top of each page
