In this audit, [Press NH Now](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyDz929Z8Ysypf3jaX60UYg) exposes the tyranny at a youth detention center.  The local Sergeant even stands up for his rights on this one.

This is my first attempt at DaVinci Resolve.  It's a learning process.  Give credit where it's due, most of the transitions and subtitles here can be found on the [original video](https://youtu.be/kUmlgtrifxA)

This video has been unlisted from YouTube.  It's an early draft.  Thinks changed, like the channel name.  We will likely remake this video with the neccessary corrections and more edits.  It can be seen here and on YouTube with a link, for now.
